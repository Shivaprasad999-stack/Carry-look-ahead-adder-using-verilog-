# 4-bit Carry Look-Ahead Adder using Verilog

This project implements a 4-bit Carry Look-Ahead Adder (CLA) using Verilog HDL. It is designed to overcome the limitations of the traditional Ripple Carry Adder (RCA) by computing carry signals in parallel, thereby minimizing propagation delay. The design is synthesized and simulated using Xilinx ISE tools and implemented on a Spartan-3E FPGA development board.

## 🔧 Features
- 4-bit CLA architecture using Generate (G) and Propagate (P) logic
- Modular Verilog code for scalability to higher bit-widths (8, 16, or 32-bit)
- Functional simulation with testbenches
- FPGA implementation and hardware verification using Spartan-3E
- Optimized for speed and resource utilization

## 🧪 Tools Used
- Verilog HDL
- Xilinx ISE / ISim
- Spartan-3E FPGA Board
- ModelSim (optional)
